Hi.

I remembered you're interested in the implementation
of the algorithm in the `paper of many authors', but didn't
have an e-mail address for you until Bruce just sent it.
The code follows.

Please note how a heap (priority queue) is used to improve
the run time given in the paper just a bit.

The end result is that it does 21 of the matches from the
paper in about 175 milliseconds (about 8ms apiece) on
a Sparc 1+.  I include the data file.

I'd be most interested in learning about bugs, as the code
should be robust --- there is a rough proof correctness
that the floating point math can't mess up the combinatorics.

/*
 *  Implementation of "An Efficiently Computable Metric
 *  for Comparing Polygonal Shapes," by Arkin, Chew, Huttenlocher,
 *  Kedem, and Mitchel (undated).  This expands a little on the
 *  cited reference to achieve O(n) space and O(mn log n)
 *  run time.
 *
 *  This could be improved to O(min m,n) and O(mn log min m,n)
 *  by selecting the smallest of the 2 polys to create the initial
 *  event heap.  See init_events().
 *
 *  Variable names match the article.
 *
 *  Implementation (c) Eugene K. Ressler 91, 92  This source may be
 *  freely distributed and used for non-commercial purposes, so long
 *  as this comment is attached to any code copied or derived from it.
 *
 * Make gcc version 2.1:
 *  gcc [-g] [-O2 -finline-functions] [-DCPU_TIME] sim.c -lm -o sim
 * Turbo C 2.0 or TC++ 1.0:
 *  tcc [-O -Z -G] sim.c -o sim.exe
 *
 * Usage:
 *  sim [-n] [-p] [-r#] [< infile] [> outfile]
 *
 * Options:
 *  -n suppresses brute force updates to reduce numerical error.
 *     This typically speeds things up a lot for big polygons.
 *     I haven't seen any inputs where the updates do much good.
 *  -p prints the metric value in full double precision.
 *  -r repeats the calculation for each polygon # times to assist in
 *     performance measure for small polygons.  This number is factored
 *     out of run time reports when compiled with -DCPU_TIME, so higher
 *     numbers compensate for grainy clocks.
 *
 * I/O:
 *  A model polygon and then any number of polygons to be compared
 *  to the model are read from standard input.  For each of the
 *  latter, a single line of metric information is written to the
 *  standard output.  Polygons are expected as counterclockwise
 *  vertex lists, one vertex (x, y) per line.  Any line that does
 *  not begin with <digit>| . | - is not scanned and
 *  taken as the end of a polygon. Output lines look like:
 *
 *  <metric> <theta* (degrees)> <f corner> <g corner> <ht0 err> <slope err> [ <cpu time in ms> ]
 *
 *  Metric and theta* are as given in the paper.  The corners are
 *  vertex numbers (0-based) of the vertices at the critical
 *  event that gave the best match.  Polygon f is the last read;
 *  g is the model.  The error terms are the maximum magnitudes of
 *  errors discovered during brute force updates.  These will be zero
 *  if the -n option is invoked.
 *
 * Bugs:
 *  The input routine uses gets() with an input buffer of 80 chars,
 *  so inputs containing long lines will cause unpredictable results.
 *
 *  We should really size things dynamically.  Currently the number of
 *  points in input polys is limited by a compile-time constant.
 *
 *  The code may not work with redundant vertices or
 *  edges that fold back on their predecessors.
 *
 *  The proof of correctness for this calculation is based on IEEE
 *  floating point numbers.  All bets are off with other standards.
 *  If the proof is wrong, it will almost inevitably show up as large
 *  numbers (over, say 10^-3) in the error terms of the heuristic.
 *
 * Compiling with -DCPU_TIME causes the time for each metric calculation
 * in ms to be appended.  Unfortunately, most systems provide this accurate
 * to 1/60 sec (16.6.. ms) only.  Small polygons take much less time than
 * this to compare.  The -r option compensates for this with a hack.
